# What is relevance search 

Relevance search helps you find what you need to complete your task in model-driven Power Apps. It delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple tables, in a single list, sorted by relevance. 
  
Relevance search brings the following enhancements and benefits:  

- **Fast search**: Fastest and most accurate search in Power Apps and a better performance compared to Categorized search. 

- **Suggested results as you type**: See top results as you type and find what you are looking for with minimal keystrokes. 

- **Better matching**: Finds matches to any word in the search term in any column in the table, compared to quick find where all words from the search term must be found in one column. 

- **Smart search**: Finds matches that include inflectional words like stream, streaming, or streamed. 

- **Search across documents in Microsoft Dataverse**: Includes search results for text in a document that's stored in Microsoft Dataverse, including text in notes and attachments. PDF, Microsoft Office documents, HTML, XML, ZIP, EML, plain text, and JSON file formats are searched.  

- **Understanding of underlying data**: Relevance search understands datatypes like choices and lookups to interpret a search query with multiple terms effectively. 

- **Operators for advanced search**: Use simple Boolean operators in your search term and craft a query to get the results you want. 

- **Intelligence**: Relevance search leverages artificial intelligence technology to interpret natural language expressions, misspellings, common abbreviations, and synonyms in an effective way to deliver quality results.
