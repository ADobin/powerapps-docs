# Advanced monitoring concepts and scenarios

Earlier you learned about the overview of Monitor, and how to use Monitor to debug canvas apps and model-driven apps. Now let’s look at a few scenarios where Monitor can shed light and solve script errors, unexpected behavior, and slowdowns.

## Custom script errors

Sometimes, a bug in the custom JS causes a script error or functionality
problem when loading a page. While this usually produces a call stack in the
dialog, it’s hard to always know where it’s coming from or decode the error.
Monitor receives events from the app with more details about the errors, so you can debug more quickly, and easily.

Let’s say a user is experiencing a script error dialog on account form load.  We can use Monitor to get more details on the event.  Once the scenario is
reproduced, you can see the script error produces an error event highlighted in red. Selecting this row gives us not only the **call stack** but
the **publisher name**, **solution name/version**, **web resource name**,
and **type** (such as *onload*, *onchange*, *RuleEvaluation*, and *CustomControl*). In this example, it looks like a typo in the script.

## Slow performance

Browser developer tools can help profile slow page loads, but there is a lot of data to filter though and it’s not clear what is important to look at.  Monitor solves this problem by showing relevant events that contribute to page load performance.

Let’s say a user is experiencing slow account form loads, and the browser is
constantly freezing up. In this case, once we reproduce, we can immediately see a performance warning telling us that a synchronous **XMLHttpRequest** was sent during the load which degraded performance.

See [previous blog post](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/turbocharge-your-model-driven-apps-by-transitioning-away-from-synchronous-requests/) for how to alleviate synchronous XHR performance problems.

For every page load, we send all KPI for the loading sequence as well as network request details as mentioned earlier.

## Collaborative troubleshooting using Monitor

Monitor tool offers two features to facilitate the collaborative troubleshooting, and debugging of Power apps problems. The **Invite** feature enables makers to share a monitoring session by inviting other members within the same organization to the same monitor session. For example, a maker troubleshooting a performance problem with Power Apps, can invite other technical support team to concurrently view all the flowing events through the same troubleshooting monitor session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Connect app** feature enable makers and support teams to share a link with end users to launch a published app and connect it to a monitor session so that, support teams can watch the sequence of events generated by end users’ interaction.

### Invite user

For a published app, maker can invite users to share a monitor session.

Maker can share real-time monitor session with others, such as a support technician, to help investigate problems.

### Connect user (for canvas apps only)

Maker can enable an end-user to launch a published app, and connect using a monitoring session. This feature allows the maker to watch the sequence of events generated while interacting with the app, and help with problem investigation.

## Unsupported scenarios for Monitor

The following scenarios aren't supported when using Monitor:

- Monitor connected to apps running on a mobile device (native players).
- Monitor connected to canvas app embedded in a model-driven app or custom page.
- Monitor connected to SharePoint custom form app.
- Monitor connected to Teams embedded app. As an alternative, play the app in a web player for diagnostics purposes.
