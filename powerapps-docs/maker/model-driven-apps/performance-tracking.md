# Performance tracking in model-driven apps

Model-driven apps use a custom performance tracking library to measure user actions.  The measurements can be tracked by makers using the [Monitor tool](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/monitor-now-supports-model-driven-apps/).

## Page KPI's
The performance tracking library creates KPI's (key performance indicators) for each user action.  User actions include:
- Page navigations (e.g. edit forms, grids, dashboards)
- Command executions
