# Dataflex vs Dataflex Pro

Applications within a Team have access to a Microsoft Dataflex environment.  

Dataflex is a common platform that allows all these interfaces to have a unified understanding of how the data is modeled and consumed. Dataflex delivers a targeted set of the features commonly needed when for creating apps, flows and more within Teams. For scenarios where an organization may require additional capabilities, more granular control for security and governance, or capacity beyond the roughly 1 million rows a Dataflex environment can contain, Dataflex can be upgraded to Dataflex Pro. 

The table below outlines the differences between Dataflex tables and Dataflex Pro entities: 


|Data feature  |Dataflex  |Dataflex Pro  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Basic data types     |  Yes       |  Yes       |
|Advanced data types​ (customer, multiple transaction currencies)      |  No       |  Yes       |
|Common Data Model    |  No       |  Yes       |
|Relational storage      | Yes       |  Yes       |
|Non-relational​ storage     |  No       |  Yes       |
|Managed data lake​      |  No       | Yes        |
|File and image support     | Yes        |  Yes       |
|Find, filter, sort     |   Yes      |  Yes       |
|Advanced and relevance search​      |   No      | Yes        |
|Mobile offline     |  No       |  Yes       |

Also note that most of the standard tables that are provided with a Dataflex Pro environment will not be present as part of Dataflex.
